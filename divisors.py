for n in range(1000 , 10000):

   for x in range(1000, n):

      if n / 6 == int():

        if n / 12 != int():
                continue

print (x, "is divisible by 6 but not 12")


# For this problem i learnt to use the error message in CMDER and VSC to isentify where i was making errors especially syntax errors.
