# I reread lecture notes and Python tutorial as initially i had the programm multiplying all the factors.
# I ran the program at one stage where it gave me the answer as 56. 
# to rectify i changed line 8 from i=1 to i=0 and i got the correct answer.
# At one stage for line 12 i tried i = i=0 but this seemed to crash CMDER and i had to restart.
