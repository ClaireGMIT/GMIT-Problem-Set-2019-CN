sentence = (input("Please enter a sentence: "))

words = sentence.split(" ")

print (words[::2])


# 1. At current stage can enter a sentence and return all characters in sentence from between position 1 and 9 using "print (s[1:9])". I'm going to try and see if i can separate via spaces and then choose every second word. 
# 2. I googled how to separate each word and seemed to find the answer at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54857129/write-a-program-that-takes-a-user-input-string-and-outputs-every-second-word. 
# there seemed to be a number of answers but i chose this one because it allowed a new variable to show that each space in a sentence is a differentiator. 
# using "words[::2]"" allowed me to print in a list every second word occurring as i had used similar idea in point 1 for characters. this method may also be helpful for Q9.
